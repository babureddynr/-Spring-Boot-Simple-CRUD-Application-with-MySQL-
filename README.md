# 🌱 **Spring Boot CRUD Application** 🌱

Welcome to the **Spring Boot CRUD Application** repository! 🚀

This project demonstrates the fundamental **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations using **Spring Boot**. The project provides a simple and clean implementation of these operations through RESTful web services.

---

## 🔍 **Features**:
- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a sample entity.
- **Spring Boot Framework**: A simple Spring Boot application to demonstrate RESTful service handling.
- **REST API**: Endpoints for managing data in a RESTful manner.
- **Database**: Uses **MySQL** to persist data.

---

## 🌟 **Tech Stack**:
- **Spring Boot**: 🌐 Backend framework for RESTful service implementation.
- **Spring Data JPA**: 💾 Handling the persistence layer and database interaction.
- **MySQL**: 🗄️ Database for storing and retrieving data.
- **Hibernate**: 🔄 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for working with MySQL.
- **Java 8+**: 🖥️ Programming language used for development.

## 🚀 **How to Run Locally**:

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/babureddynr/SPRING-MVC-KIRANSIR.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd SPRING-MVC-KIRANSIR
```

### 3. Update your **`application.properties`** with your MySQL credentials:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
```

### 4. Run the application:
You can run the application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, if you're using an IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**, you can run the main class **`Application.java`** directly.

### 5. Access the REST API:
Once the application is up and running, you can access the CRUD API endpoints:

- **Create**: `POST /api/entity`
- **Read**: `GET /api/entity/{id}`
- **Update**: `PUT /api/entity/{id}`
- **Delete**: `DELETE /api/entity/{id}`

You can use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to test these endpoints.

## ✨ **Improvements to Add**:
- **Implement validation** for input data to enhance the API's robustness.
- **Add pagination** for the list of records.
- **Create front-end interface** (optional) for users to interact with the CRUD operations.
- **Handle exceptions** more gracefully and provide detailed error messages.

## 📚 **Project Overview**:
This application is designed to manage simple entities (such as users or products) and provides the basic functionality to add, view, update, and delete records from a MySQL database using Spring Boot and JPA.

---

## 🛠️ **API Endpoints**:
Here are the available endpoints:

- **POST** `/api/entity`: Create a new entity.
- **GET** `/api/entity/{id}`: Fetch an entity by its ID.
- **PUT** `/api/entity/{id}`: Update an existing entity by its ID.
- **DELETE** `/api/entity/{id}`: Delete an entity by its ID.

## 📚 **Acknowledgments**:
- **Spring Boot**: For making development fast and easy with a range of powerful features.
- **MySQL**: For reliable and scalable database management.
- **Hibernate**: For making database interaction seamless with ORM.
